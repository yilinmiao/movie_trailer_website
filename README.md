# Movie Trailer Website
A Python program that produces the HTML for a movie website that displays
a number of movies. Click on a movie poster to play its trailer.

## How to Build the Page in the Terminal

repository to your desktop.

Open the text-based interface for your operating system (e.g. the terminal
window in Linux, the command prompt in Windows).

Navigate to the project directory and type in the following command:
